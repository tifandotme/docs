# Getting Started

## Setting Up Go Environment

On a clean system, we first need to check these two:

1. `go` command is available. Try running `go verison`.
2. `$PATH` contain `$GOPATH/bin` so that we can run Go programs installed from `go install`

There is a popular version manager called [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). It works like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node. But, we first needs the `go` command to be present before installing any Go version with GVM.

<Steps>
### Install Go Development Tools

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang-go

# Fedora
sudo dnf install golang
```

### Install GVM (optional)

Plese [refer to this](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm#installing) for complete instructions.

### Install latest version of Go with GVM (optional)

Check current up-to-date version from go.dev, then run:

```bash
gvm install go1.21.1 # download version 1.21.1 (example)
```

To use the version, run:

```bash
gvm use go1.21.1
```

> The benefit of GVM is that so we can install the latest Go version. Because often times popular package manager like `apt` doesn't provide the most up to date version.

### Configure $PATH

Add to `.profile` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export GOPATH="$HOME/.local/share/go"
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

> Check current PATH configuration with: `printenv PATH`

</Steps>

## Running and Building

There are two similar commands: `go run` and `go build`. The difference is:

- go run compiles the code into a binary into a temporary directory, excecutes it, and then deletes the binary after the program finishes
- go build compiles the source code into a binary

Use -o flag to store in a different location:

```bash
go build -o custom_name hello.go
```

<Callout>
Use `go run` to treat your source code as a script. Use `go build` to distribute your program for other people to use.
</Callout>

## Using Third Party Tools

Some people choose to distribute their Go programs as pre-compiled binaries, but we can also built one from the source code direcly with `go install`. Go doesn't have have centralized hosted service like NPM registry, instead it relies on source code repositories to share projects.

For example to install Go tools called __hey__ from github.com/rakyll/hey, we run:

```bash
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
```

Include _@latest_ to use the latest version or any version of your choosing. Please note you have to have $GOPATH/bin already set up in PATH environment variable to be able to run the binary after installing it.

If you have already installed a tool and want to update it to a newer version, rerun `go install` with the newer version specified or with _@latest_ (same as above)
