# Getting Started

## Expectation

Go programming language is made to allow developers to write code more efficiently. We can expect these points:

- Go syntax is intentionally simple and boring .
- A fast compiler.
- Less flexibility on how code is laid out, compared to TypeScript.
- Tabs for indentation is enforced.

## Setting Up Go Environment

On a clean system, we first need to check these two:

1. `go` command is available. Try running `go verison`.
2. `$PATH` contain `$GOPATH/bin` so that we can run Go programs installed from `go install`

There is a popular version manager called [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). It works like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node. But, we first needs the `go` command to be present before installing any Go version with GVM.

<Steps>
### Install Go Devevelopment Tools

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang-go

# Fedora
sudo dnf install golang
```

### Install GVM (optional)

Plese [refer to this](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm#installing) for complete instructions.

### Install latest version of Go with GVM (optional)

Check current up-to-date version from go.dev, then run:

```bash
gvm install go1.21.1 # download version 1.21.1 (example)
```

To use the version, run:

```bash
gvm use go1.21.1
```

> The benefit of GVM is that so we can install the latest Go version. Because often times popular package manager like `apt` doesn't provide the most up to date version.

### Configure $PATH

Add to `.profile` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export GOPATH="$HOME/.local/share/go"
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

> Check current PATH configuration with: `printenv PATH`

</Steps>

## Running and Building

There are two similar commands: `go run` and `go build`. The difference is:

- go run compiles the code into a binary into a temporary directory, excecutes it, and then deletes the binary after the program finishes
- go build compiles the source code into a binary

Use -o flag to store in a different location:

```bash
go build -o custom_name hello.go
```

<Callout>
  Use `go run` to treat your source code as a script. Use `go build` to
  distribute your program for other people to use.
</Callout>

## Using Third Party Tools

Some people choose to distribute their Go programs as pre-compiled binaries, but we can also built one from the source code directly with `go install`. Go doesn't have have centralized hosted service like NPM registry, instead it relies on source code repositories to share projects.

For example to install Go tools called **hey** from github.com/rakyll/hey, run:

```bash
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
```

Include **@latest** to use the latest version or any version of your choosing. Please note you have to have $GOPATH/bin already set up in PATH environment variable to be able to run the binary after installing it.

If you have already installed a tool and want to update it to a newer version, rerun `go install` with the newer version specified or with **@latest** (same as above)

## Formatting

Go development tools include `go fmt` to format code, such as fixing white-space indentation, lining fields in a struct, and ensuring proper spacing around operators.

But, there is an enhanced version called `goimports` that does the same thing, but also cleans import statements. It puts them in alphabetical order, removing unused imports, guessing unspecified imports. Although, its guesses is innacurate, so it's better to import them yourself.

Install goimports with `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest` and run it accross the project with:

```bash
goimports -l -w .
```

- -l prints the files with incorrect formatting.
- -w tells it to modify the files in-place.

## Linting

**Idiomatic** in programming refers to code that follows the estabilished conventions and style of the language and community. To ensure your code is idiomatic and high quality, we can:

- Use `go fmt` to format our code.
- Enforce idiomatic style using `golint`

Don't always assume that `golint` is 100% accurate, the issues that it finds are somewhat fuzzy and somtimes has false positives and false negatives. This means you don't have to make the changes that it suggests, but you can take it seriously.

Install `golint` with:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/lint/golint@latest
```

Run it accross the project with:

```bash
golint ./...
```
