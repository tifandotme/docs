# Getting Started

## Setting Up Go Environment

On a clean system, we first need to check these two:

1. `go` command is available. Try running `go verison`.
2. `$PATH` contain `$GOPATH/bin` so that we can run Go programs installed from `go install`

There is a popular version manager called [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). It works like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node. But, we first needs the `go` command to be present before installing any Go version with GVM.

<Steps>
### Install Go Development Tools

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang-go

# Fedora
sudo dnf install golang
```

### Install GVM (optional)

Plese [refer to this](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm#installing) for complete instructions.

### Install latest version of Go with GVM (optional)

Check current up-to-date version from go.dev, then run:

```bash
gvm install go1.21.1 # download version 1.21.1 (example)
```

To use the version, run:

```bash
gvm use go1.21.1
```

> The benefit of GVM is that so we can install the latest Go version. Because often times popular package manager like `apt` doesn't provide the most up to date version.

### Configure $PATH

Add to `.profile` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export GOPATH="$HOME/.local/share/go"
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

> Check current PATH configuration with: `printenv PATH`

</Steps>

# Managing Packages

Go doesn't have doesn't have centralized hosted service like NPM registry, instead it relies on source code repositories to share projects.

`go install [github.com/rakyll/hey@latest](http://github.com/rakyll/hey@latest)`. This downloads hey and its dependencies, build, and installs the binary in $GOPATH/.bin
