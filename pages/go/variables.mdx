# Variables

## Zero Values

By default, any variables that are declared but not initialized will be set to their zero value:

- Integer types = 0
- Floating point types = 0.0
- Boolean = false
- String = ""
- Pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, maps = nil

## Numeric types

Go has several numeric types:

- Integers
- Floating point numbers
- Complex numbers (we rarely use these, so we won't cover them)

| Type name | Value range                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| int8      | -128 to 127                                 |
| int16     | -32768 to 32767                             |
| int32     | -2147483648 to 2147483647                   |
| int64     | -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 |
| uint8     | 0 to 255                                    |
| uint16    | 0 to 65536                                  |
| uint32    | 0 to 4294967295                             |
| uint64    | 0 to 18446744073709551615                   |
| float32   | IEEE-754 32-bit standard                    |
| float64   | IEEE-754 64-bit standard                    |

Similar to TypeScript, you can add underscores to make large numbers more readable.

```go
var a = 1_000_000
```

### Integers

Integer types defaults to `int` if no type is specified. Signed integers can be positive or negative. Unsigned integers can only be positive. Go does have special names for integer types:

- `byte` = alias for `uint8`.
- `int` = alias for `int32` on 32-bit systems and `int64` on 64-bit systems.
- `uint` = same size as `int`, but unsigned.
- `rune` =
- `uintptr` =

<Callout type="warning">
  It's a compile-time error to assign, compare, perform math operations between
  an `int` and `int32` without type conversion.
</Callout>

### Floating points

Floating point types defaults to `float64` if no type is specified. Floating point number cannot represent decimal values exactly. Don't use them to represent money or any values that must have exact decimal representation. Due to this, don't compare floats with == or !=.

### Arithmetic operators

For integers:

- Support the usual arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, and % for modulus
- The result of an integer division is an integer, if you want to get a floating point result, you need to use a type conversion to make your integers into floating point numbers.
- Be careful not to divide an integer by 0; this causes a panic

For floating points:

- Support the same arithmetic operators as integers, but not %.
- Dividing non-zero floating point variable by 0 returns either +Inf or -Inf.
- Dividing 0 floating point variable by 0 returns NaN (not a number).

You can combine any of the arithmetic operators with = to modify a variable: +=, -=,
\*=, /=, and %=.

You compare integers with ==, !=, >, >=, \<, and \<=.

Bit-manipulation operators for integers are also available:

- Bit shift left and right with \<\< and >>
- Bit masks with & (logical AND), | (logical OR), ^ (logical XOR),
  and &^ (logical AND NOT)
- Combine all of the logical operators with = to modify a variable: &=, |=, ^=, &^=, \<\<=, and >>=.


## Booleans

The `bool` type represents boolean variables. It can only have two values: true or false.

## Strings

Unlike C, Go includes strings as built-in types
