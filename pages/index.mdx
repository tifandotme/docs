## Philosophy

There are tons of sources to learn new topics from:

- Documentations
- Courses
- Articles
- YouTube

Simply reading them passively isn't that effective for retaining the knowledge I have learned for long-term use. Often, I create a summary or recap so that I can refer back to my writings to refresh my memory without having to search for the information from scratch again.

I've tried Notion and recently Obsidian, both tools are great, but I believe that when I make this information public and use a DIY platform, I'm more inclined to put more care into it. Additionally, other developers might also benefit from this, which is a nice feeling to know.

## Guidelines

- Every section is written to be succinct, including only information that's worth paying attention to.
- If it's better to read from the source material, I'll simply provide the link (e.g. installation instruction).
- Not everything follows the industry best practices or common conventions. As a learn more, old information might not be ideal anymore. But I always tried to keep it updated.
