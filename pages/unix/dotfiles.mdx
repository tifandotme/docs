# .bashrc vs .bash_profile

`.bashrc`:

- Excecuted every time the terminal opens
- Used to run commands that should run every time a shell is launched, for example aliases, functions, history customization, custom prompts, etc.

`.bash_profile`:

- Excecuted only once on session start
- Used to run commands that are needed only one, for example `$PATH` environment variables

# Common convention

- Store application data at `~/.local/share`
- Store application config at `~/.config`
